A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/joacimnilsson/pen/CtIih.

 Hope you like this top menu. The goal is to be super minimal in the HTML and the same for the CSS. The CSS is a bit messy but I think you can understand it.

Forked from [Jack hamilton](http://codepen.io/jackdh/)'s Pen [Responsive Top Menu Pure CSS and HTML by Joni](http://codepen.io/jackdh/pen/czKGa/).
